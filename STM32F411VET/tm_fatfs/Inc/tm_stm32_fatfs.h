 * @{
 *
 * FatFs implementation for STM32F4xx devices
 *
 * This library uses Chan's Fatfs implementation.
 * 
 * This library is only for communication. To work with files, you have to look at Chan's FatFs manual, link below:
 * http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html
 *
 * You can work with SPI or SDIO protocol to interface SDCARD.
 *
 * \par SDCARD pinouts
 *
 * Library works with SPI or SDIO mode. Also, when in SDIO mode, you can set to 1- or 4-bit mode.
 * By default, SDIO with 4-bit mode is used, so you will look into right column on table below.
 * 
 * SD CARD PINS

 * \par SDIO Communication
 * 
 * By default, SDIO with 4-bit communication is used.
 * If you want to use SDIO 1-bit communication, set defines below in your defines.h file:
 * 
\code
//Set SDIO with 1-bit communication
#define FATFS_SDIO_4BIT   0
\endcode
 * 
 * For SDIO communication, you will need at least these files:
 *
\verbatim
- tm_stm32_fatfs.h
- tm_stm32_fatfs.c
- fatfs/diskio.h
- fatfs/diskio.c
- fatfs/ff.h
- fatfs/ff.c
- fatfs/ffconf.h
- fatfs/integer.h
- fatfs/option/syscall.c
- fatfs/option/unicode.c
- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_sd_sdio.h
- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_sd_sdio.c
\endverbatim 
 *
 * \par SPI Communication
 * 
 * Or, if you want to use SPI communication, you have to add lines below in your defines.h file
 *	
\code
//Enable SPI communication, disable SDIO
#define FATFS_USE_SDIO   0
\endcode
 *	
 * Files, needed for SPI:
 *
\verbatim
- tm_stm32_fatfs.h
- tm_stm32_fatfs.c
- fatfs/diskio.h
- fatfs/diskio.c
- fatfs/ff.h
- fatfs/ff.c
- fatfs/ffconf.h
- fatfs/integer.h
- fatfs/option/syscall.c
- fatfs/option/unicode.c
- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_sd.h
- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_sd.c
\endverbatim 
 * 
 * \par Overwriting default pinout
 * 
 * SDIO interface pins are fixed, and can not be changed.
 * If you want to change SPI pins, you have to set these defines in your defines.h file:
 * 
\code
//Set your SPI, for corresponding pins look at TM SPI library
#define FATFS_SPI               SPI1
#define FATFS_SPI_PINSPACK      TM_SPI_PinsPack_1
	
//Set your CS pin for SPI			
#define FATFS_CS_PORT           GPIOB
#define FATFS_CS_PIN            GPIO_PIN_5
\endcode
 *
 * \par Write protect and Card detect pins
 *
 * Library has support for Card detect and Write protect pins.
 *
 * It is the same for any communication used and is disabled by default.
 * 
\verbatim
NAME    STM32Fxxx   DESCRIPTION
	
CD      PB6         Card detect pin. Pin low when card detected
CD      PB7         Card write protect pin. Pin low when card write is enabled
\endverbatim
 *
 * Like I said before, these 2 pins are disabled by default. If you want to use it, you have to add 2 lines in your defines.h file:
 *
\code
//Enable Card detect pin
#define FATFS_USE_DETECT_PIN               1

//Enable Write protect pin
#define FATFS_USE_WRITEPROTECT_PIN         1
\endcode
 * 
 * WP and CD pins are now enabled with default configuration.
 *
 * Add lines below to your defines.h file only if you want to overwrite default pin settings:
 *
\code
//Default CD pin			
#define FATFS_DETECT_PORT          GPIOB
#define FATFS_DETECT_PIN           GPIO_PIN_6

//Default WP pin			
#define FATFS_WRITEPROTECT_PORT    GPIOB
#define FATFS_WRITEPROTECT_PIN     GPIO_PIN_7
\endcode
 *
 * \par Timing function for files
 * 
 * FatFs uses function get_fattime() for time, to set timestamp for files, when they were edited or created.
 * 
 * By default, function returns 0, but if you want to create your own function, you have to set defines in defines.h file:
 * 
\code
//Use custom get_fattime() function
#define FATFS_CUSTOM_FATTIME	1
\endcode
 *
 * And then somewhere in your project, add function like below:
 * 
\code
//Use custom get_fattime function
//Implement RTC get time here if you need it
DWORD get_fattime (void) {
	//Get your time from RTC or something like that
	
return  ((DWORD)(2014 - 1980) << 25)  // Year 2014
        | ((DWORD)7 << 21)            // Month 7
        | ((DWORD)10 << 16)           // Mday 10
        | ((DWORD)16 << 11)           // Hour 16
        | ((DWORD)0 << 5)             // Min 0
        | ((DWORD)0 >> 1);            // Sec 0
}
\endcode
 *
 * \par Use FATFS with USB MSC Host library.
 * 
 * You can use this library also with @ref TM_USBH_MSC Library if you want to ready USB Flash keys when needed. 
 *
 * First, files you will need for implementation based on FATFS are:
 *
\verbatim
- tm_stm32_fatfs.h
- tm_stm32_fatfs.c
- fatfs/diskio.h
- fatfs/diskio.c
- fatfs/ff.h
- fatfs/ff.c
- fatfs/ffconf.h
- fatfs/integer.h
- fatfs/option/syscall.c
- fatfs/option/unicode.c
- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_usb.h
- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_usb.c
- Entire USB MSC Host stack and TM USB library
\endverbatim 
 *
 * \par Operate with USB MSC Host libraries.
 *
 * Because my USB MSC Host library supports both USB modes at the same time, I've made 2 different names for logical drivers.
 * So, when you wanna mount/read/write/etc, you have 2 possible drive names:
 *
\code
//Mount USB Flash memory connected on USB FS port
f_mount(&fatfs_FS, "USBFS:", 1);

//Mount USB Flash memory connected on USB HS port
f_mount(&fatfs_HS, "USBHS:", 1);
\endcode
 *
 * Like SDCARD has "SD:" name, here are 2 different names, which allows you flexibility in your code.
 * This also means, that you can use SDCARD and 2 USB flash drives at the same time without any problems, just specifying drive name
 * when performing read and write operations.
 *
 * \par Search for files
 *
 * I've added support for easy search function for files/folders on your FATFS related device. It works with any device (SDCARD, USB, etc),
 * because you specify starting path for search which is specified by FATFS.
 *
 * There are 2 functions for search, one is @ref TM_FATFS_Search which you should call when you want to do a search operations in your FATFS structure
 *
 * Second is @ref TM_FATFS_SearchCallback which is called anytime file/folder is found on system so user can do his job with file.
 *
\code
int user_func(void) {
	//Create working buffer
	char working_buffer[200];
	
	FRESULT res;
	TM_FATFS_Search_t FindStructure;
	
	//mount first
	
	if ((res = TM_FATFS_Search("SD:", working_buffer, sizeof(working_buffer), &FindStructure)) == FR_OK) {
		//Search was OK
	} else if (res == FR_NOT_ENOUGH_CORE) {
		//Not enough buffer memory for full search operation
	}
	
	//unmount
}

uint8_t TM_FATFS_SearchCallback(char* path, uint8_t is_file, TM_FATFS_Search_t* FindStructure) {
	//Check for file/folder
	if (is_file) {
		printf("File: %s", path);
	} else {
		printf("Folder: %s", path);
	}

	//Allow next search
	return 1;
}
\endcode
 *
 * Check documentation for these 2 functions for more info.
 *
