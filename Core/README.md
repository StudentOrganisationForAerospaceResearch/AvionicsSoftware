# Core

The `Core` directory contains code generated by STM32CubeIDE, Middlewares like FreeRTOS, and other integrated libraries and linker files.

Most components of the code should go into the Components folder instead, only make changes to the .ioc here if necessary, using the interface in CubeIDE.
